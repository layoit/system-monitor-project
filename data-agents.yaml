        # --- IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE ---
        # `privileged: true` is generally NOT recommended in production due to security risks.
        # It's included here because vmstat/sar often require elevated privileges to run
        # inside a container and access host-like metrics. For a real production system,
        # you'd use a more secure host monitoring solution (like Prometheus Node Exporter)
        # or research specific Linux capabilities needed instead of full privilege.
        securityContext:
          privileged: true
